### CreateCommand feature by [Xylon Chan](team/xylonchan.md)

The `Create-project` command is facilitated by `ProjectList`and it is accessed by `CommandContext`. It extends `Command` with the feature of reading the user's project name input and creating a project entity.
Additionally , it implements the following operations:
- `ProjectList#getProject(String name)` - returns the project if it exists, or `null` if not found.
- `ProjectList#addProject(String name)` - adds a new project with the given name.
- `ConsoleUi#showAddedProject()` - notifies the user after successful creation.
- `CommandContext#getProjects()` - returns all the projects currently in the ProjectList

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `create-project` feature behaves at each step

**User Input**: The user enters the `create-project` command with the project name (e.g., `create-project Alpha`).

**Parsing**: The CommandParser identifies the command as `create-project` and constructs a CreateCommand with the raw arguments.

**Execution**: The FlowCLI main loop invokes CreateCommand#execute(CommandContext). (Note: CreateCommand extends Command.)

**Argument Parsing**: Inside execute, CreateCommand extracts the project name from the arguments 

**Validation**: The command validates that the name is non-blank; if blank, it throws `MissingArgumentException`. It then checks duplicates via `context.getProjects().getProject(name)` if present, it throws `ProjectAlreadyExistsException`.

**Creating the Project**: On success, the command calls `context.getProjects().addProject(name)` to persist the new project in the model.

**UI Feedback**: The command obtains the UI via context.getUi() and calls showAddedProject() (or the equivalent success method) to confirm creation to the user.

**Return/Logging**: The command returns true to signal success and logs at info/fine levels; failures log at warning and do not mutate the model.


Here is a sequence diagram illustrating the process:

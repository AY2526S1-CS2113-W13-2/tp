# FlowCLI - Class Documentation

FlowCLI is a Command Line Interface (CLI) app for managing tasks and projects, optimised for fast, fully keyboard-driven workflows. Track priorities, deadlines and statuses of your projects, filter and sort instantly, then export the current view to a TXT file to save your changes. If you're a fast typer, FlowCLI is perfect for you - save hours on project management as it gets your work done faster than click-heavy apps.

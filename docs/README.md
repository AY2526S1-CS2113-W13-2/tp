# FlowCLI - Class Documentation

FlowCLI is a terminal-first app for managing tasks and projects, optimised for fast, fully keyboard-driven workflows. Track priorities and deadlines, group by project, filter and sort instantly, then export the current view to a TXT file. If you type quickly, FlowCLI gets your task management done faster than click-heavy apps.

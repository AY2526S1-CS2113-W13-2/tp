## Overview
FlowCLI is a keyboard-first task and project manager built for speed. Create projects and track tasks with priorities, deadlines, and completion states, then slice the list instantly with filtering and sorting. Use concise inline commands when you know exactly what you want, or switch to interactive prompts for a guided flow. When you’re done, export a clean text report for sharing or record‑keeping.

#### Enhancements implemented

- **Filename validation and robust error messaging for export paths**
  - **What it does**: Added cross-platform filename validation logic and clearer exceptions to prevent invalid filenames and improve user feedback during export.
  - **Justification**: Invalid filenames are a frequent user pitfall; early validation prevents partial runs and confusing errors.
  - **Highlights**: Validated illegal characters, enforced `.txt` extension, and produced actionable messages reused by the final handler.
  - **Code**: Validation logic integrated within export handling utilities.

- **Command validation utilities**
  - **What it does**: Introduced centralized validation via `CommandValidator` and constants in `ValidationConstants` (priority, sort/filter options, date parsing, keywords).
  - **Justification**: Consolidates duplicated checks across commands, ensures consistent rules and messages, and simplifies testing.
  - **Highlights**: Implemented `validatePriority`, `validateSortField`, `validateSortOrder`, `validateFilterType`, and `validateAndParseDate`; shared constants power filter/sort/export/update flows.
  - **Code**: `commands/validation/CommandValidator.java`, `commands/validation/ValidationConstants.java`

- **Error handling and custom exceptions**
  - **What it does**: Implemented targeted exceptions and validation paths to surface precise, actionable errors to users.
  - **Justification**: Clear error boundaries and specific exception types improve debuggability, testability, and overall UX in a CLI where feedback is textual.
  - **Highlights**: Added and integrated the following exceptions used across parsing, validation, and export flows:
    - `InvalidCommandSyntaxException`
    - `InvalidDateException`
    - `InvalidFilenameException`
    - `InvalidIndexFormatException`
    - Performed a refactor to split a catch‑all `InvalidArgumentException` into these specific classes, improving error granularity and message quality.

- **Legacy Export Prototype and View-State Design**
  - **What it does**: Implemented an export flow prototype (legacy syntax) with view-state awareness so users could quickly export the last shown list or a filtered/sorted subset without retyping options.
  - **Justification**: Exporting the “current view” is a common CLI workflow. Capturing the last displayed tasks and associated metadata enables a faster export UX and informed success messages.
  - **Highlights**: Designed parsing of chained options (filter-by priority, sort-by field/order), filename checks, and safe defaults. The core ideas informed the final `ExportCommand` and `ExportCommandHandler` behavior.
  - **Code**: `unused/LegacyExportSupport.java` (view-state + parsing utilities)

#### Contributions to the User Guide (UG)

- Updated the Export tasks section to be more comprehensive.
- Added concise "Common mistakes and fixes" blocks under `add-task`, `update-task`, `sort-tasks`, `filter-tasks`, and `export-tasks` to speed up troubleshooting.

#### Contributions to the Developer Guide (DG)

- Documented the export section and key classes.
- Added Validation Framework subsection documenting centralized input validation and error handling.

#### Contributions to team-based tasks

- Designed the UX for `export-tasks` (flows, prompts, confirmations).
- Drove comprehensive error handling and supported bug triage and fixes.

#### Review/mentoring contributions

- Reviewed PRs touching command parsing and message conventions to keep CLI outputs consistent.
- Provided feedback on sorting/filtering interactions with export to maintain a coherent UX.

#### Contributions beyond the project team

- Standardised comprehensive PR descriptions and commit messages across the team to improve review quality and traceability.

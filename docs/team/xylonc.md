## Overview
FlowCLI is a command-line app for managing tasks and projects, built for speed and full keyboard control. Track priorities, deadlines, and statuses, filter and sort in an instant, then export your current view to TXT. If you type fast, FlowCLI helps you move faster than click-heavy apps.

### Enhancements implemented 

#### Project Management implementation 

##### Summary 
The project management component managed all project-related functionality in FlowCLI. They define how projects are created, stored, retrieved, and displayed within the application. Key classes handle the project list, individual project objects, and persistence of project data. 

##### Example 
The `Create-project` command class enables users to add new projects through the CLI by parsing user input, validating project names, checking for duplicates, and updating the project list accordingly. Together, these components form the backbone of project creation and management in FlowCLI.

##### Testing of code 
Contributed to the maintainance as well as the testing of the commands and new features at every stage of the app development. Using concepts learnt in class like assertions , logging and design test cases , created Junit tests to ensure the code work the way it was intended do 

##### Contributions to the User Guide (UG)
- Updated the parts relevant to the additions I added, ensured that the user will have a easy time reading, understanding and implementing the code in our project.
- Also helped read the parts of my teammates and ensured our explanations aligned while also ensuring that the UG is cohesive when read as a whole

##### Contributions to the Developer Guide (DG) 
- Added the section on project management in the DG where it explains how that component function.
- Elaborated by explaining the feature of CreateCommand and how it works as well as using a diagram to explain how the component works and the classes involved 
- Helped to read through and ensure the parts were cohesive 

##### Contributions to team-based tasks
- Helped to drive and facilitate discussion during group calls, enusring everyone had an opportunity to voice their opinions and concerns when brainstorming 
- Led the brainstroming of the app we as a group wanted to create, actively encouraging my teammates to run through their ideas and concerns during the planning stage
- Hosted weekly calls with the group and found the times that best suited everyone

##### Contributions beyond the team project
- Actively volunteer to submit group submissions during the tutorials, actively ensuring everyone was involved and had a chance to participate 
- Actively participated and fostered a condusive environment during tutorials for discussion and learning of new concepts.

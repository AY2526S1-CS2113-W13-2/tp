## Project: FlowCLI

FlowCLI is a desktop task management application designed for university students to organize their academic projects and personal tasks. It features a command-line interface with an optional interactive mode for guided task management, supporting project creation, task CRUD operations, sorting, filtering, and data export capabilities. The application is written in Java and follows the Model-View-Controller architecture pattern.

## Overview

FlowCLI addresses the challenge of managing complex academic or personal projects by providing a streamlined, command-line interface for task and project organization. It helps student developers maintain focus, track progress, and efficiently handle multiple assignments or project phases without the overhead of graphical user interfaces. By offering quick task creation, flexible filtering, and clear status overviews, FlowCLI ensures that users can dedicate more time to coding and less to administrative overhead, ultimately boosting productivity and reducing stress.

### Features / Enhancements implemented

#### 1. Sorting / Filtering Inline Commands and Algorithms

- **What it does**: Implements global task sorting and filtering functionality accessible via command-line interface, allowing users to organize and narrow down tasks across all projects.
- **Justification**: Essential feature for task management applications to help users prioritize work and focus on relevant tasks in large project portfolios.
- **Highlights**: Implemented efficient algorithms with O(n log n) sorting complexity and O(n) filtering complexity. Added comprehensive JUnit test coverage with 13 test cases. Integrated parameter validation and error handling for robust user experience.
- **Code contributed**: `TaskSorter.java`, `TaskFilter.java`, `CommandHandler.java` (sort/filter command parsing), comprehensive test suite in `TaskSorterTest.java` and `TaskFilterTest.java`.

#### 2. Interactive Mode Implementation

- **What it does**: Transforms single-word commands into guided conversational interfaces, providing step-by-step prompts for complex operations without requiring users to remember full command syntax.
- **Justification**: Reduces learning curve for new users and prevents command errors by guiding users through parameter collection with validation and clear options.
- **Highlights**: Implemented 10+ interactive command flows with tsundere personality prompts, recursive field updates for multi-parameter editing, comprehensive input validation, and proper error handling. Integrated into existing command architecture without breaking backward compatibility.
- **Code contributed**: `InteractivePromptHandler.java` (849+ lines), `CommandHandler.java` integration, all interactive command methods with validation logic.

### Contributions to the User Guide

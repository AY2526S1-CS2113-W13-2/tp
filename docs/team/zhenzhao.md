## Overview

FlowCLI is a Command Line Interface (CLI) application for managing tasks and projects, optimized for fast, fully keyboard-driven workflows. It offers two convenient ways to work: inline commands for power users who want to type everything at once, and interactive mode for guided step-by-step input. Users can track priorities, deadlines and statuses of their projects, filter and sort instantly, then export the current view to a TXT file.

As the technical lead for the foundational architecture, I was responsible for designing and implementing the core command processing infrastructure, project and task management systems, and the status display feature. My contributions focused on creating a robust, extensible architecture that enables efficient command handling and provides users with comprehensive project tracking capabilities.

### Enhancements Implemented

#### 1. Command Processing Infrastructure
- **What it does**: Provides a centralized, extensible framework for parsing and executing user commands through `CommandHandler`, `CommandParser`, and `ArgumentParser` classes.
- **Justification**: This infrastructure is critical for maintaining clean separation of concerns and enabling easy addition of new commands without modifying existing code. It supports both inline command mode and interactive mode seamlessly.
- **Highlights**: The design uses the Command pattern to encapsulate command logic, making the system highly maintainable and testable. The `ArgumentParser` utility provides robust flag-based argument parsing that all commands can leverage.
- **Code contributed**: 
  - `CommandHandler` class: Core command execution loop and coordination [\[Functional code\]](../../src/main/java/seedu/flowcli/commands/core/CommandHandler.java)
  - `CommandParser` class: Command parsing and routing logic [\[Functional code\]](../../src/main/java/seedu/flowcli/parsers/CommandParser.java)
  - `ArgumentParser` class: Reusable argument parsing utility [\[Functional code\]](../../src/main/java/seedu/flowcli/parsers/ArgumentParser.java)

#### 2. Core Data Models (Project and Task Management)
- **What it does**: Implements the fundamental `Project`, `ProjectList`, `Task`, and `TaskList` classes that form the backbone of FlowCLI's data management.
- **Justification**: These classes provide a clean, object-oriented approach to managing hierarchical project-task relationships with built-in validation and error handling.

### Command Processing Infrastructure

The command processing infrastructure forms the backbone of FlowCLI's architecture, enabling efficient parsing and execution of user commands. This system consists of three main components:

**Architecture Overview:**

1. **CommandHandler**: Coordinates the command execution loop, managing the application's main control flow
2. **CommandParser**: Analyzes user input and creates appropriate Command objects based on the input string
3. **ArgumentParser**: Provides utility methods for extracting flags and arguments from command strings

**Design Rationale:**

The infrastructure follows the Command pattern, where each command encapsulates its own execution logic. This design:
- Enables easy addition of new commands without modifying existing code (Open-Closed Principle)
- Separates command parsing from execution (Single Responsibility Principle)
- Makes commands independently testable
- Supports both inline and interactive command modes through a unified interface

**Sequence Diagram:**

The following sequence diagram illustrates how a user command flows through the system:

![Command Processing Sequence](../plantUML/command-processing-sequence/Command%20Processing%20Sequence%20Diagram.png)

**Implementation Details:**

The `ArgumentParser` class provides flag-based argument extraction, which all commands leverage for consistent input handling:

```java
public static String getArgumentForFlag(String input, String flag) 
        throws MissingArgumentException {
    // Extract argument following the specified flag
    // Throws exception if flag is present but argument is missing
}
```

### Status Display System

The status display system provides users with comprehensive project progress tracking, featuring completion percentages, visual progress bars, and context-aware motivational messages.

**Architecture Overview:**

The system separates concerns through two main components:
- **StatusCommand**: Handles user interaction and command routing
- **ProjectStatusAnalyzer**: Performs progress calculation and generates status data

**Class Diagram:**

![Status Display Class Diagram](../plantUML/status-display-system/Status%20Display%20Class%20Diagram.png)

**Execution Flow:**

When a user executes `status <projectIndex>` or `status --all`, the following sequence occurs:

![Status Command Sequence](../plantUML/status-command-sequence/Status%20Command%20Sequence%20Diagram.png)

**Implementation Details:**

The `ProjectStatusAnalyzer` calculates completion metrics:

```java
public static ProjectStatus analyzeProject(Project project) {
    int totalTasks = project.size();
    int completedTasks = 0;
    
    for (Task task : project.getProjectTasks().getTasks()) {
        if (task.isDone()) {
            completedTasks++;
        }
    }
    
    int percentage = (totalTasks == 0) ? 0 : (completedTasks * 100) / totalTasks;
    return new ProjectStatus(totalTasks, completedTasks, percentage);
}
```

**Display Features:**

1. **Progress Bar**: Visual representation using ASCII characters (`[=====>     ]` format with percentage)
2. **Completion Percentage**: Numerical progress indicator
3. **Motivational Messages**: Context-aware messages based on completion level:
   - ≤25%: "You are kinda cooked, start doing your tasks!"
   - ≤50%: "You gotta lock in and finish all tasks!"
   - ≤75%: "We are on the right track, keep completing your tasks!"
   - >75%: "We are finishing all tasks!! Upzzz!"

---

### Common Classes

The common classes form FlowCLI's core data model, providing robust project and task management capabilities.

**Class Overview:**

- **Project**: Represents a project containing multiple tasks, with methods for task CRUD operations
- **ProjectList**: Manages the collection of all projects with validation and search capabilities
- **Task**: Represents an individual task with description, priority, deadline, and completion status
- **TaskList**: Manages collections of tasks with validation and index-based access

**Design Principles:**

These classes follow object-oriented design principles:
- **Encapsulation**: Internal state is private with controlled access through methods
- **Validation**: All operations include input validation with meaningful exceptions
- **Immutability where appropriate**: Certain fields are final to prevent unintended modifications

**Example Usage:**

```java
// Creating a project with tasks
Project project = new Project("CS2113T Project");
Task task = new Task("Implement feature", Priority.HIGH, "2025-11-15");
project.addTask(task);

// Managing projects
ProjectList projects = new ProjectList();
projects.add(project);
Project retrieved = projects.getProjectByIndex(0);
```

### Common Workflows

Here are practical examples of how to combine commands for common use cases:

#### Daily Task Review
```bash
# Check what's urgent
filter-tasks --priority high
status --all

# Review and update a task
list 1
update-task 1 2 --deadline 2025-11-15
mark 1 1
```

#### Weekly Planning
```bash
# See all upcoming deadlines
sort-tasks --deadline ascending

# Export high-priority items for the week
export-tasks weekly-plan.txt filter-tasks --priority high sort-tasks --deadline ascending
```

#### Project Cleanup
```bash
# Check project status
status --all

# Mark completed tasks
mark 1 1
mark 1 3

# Remove finished tasks
delete-task 1 1
```

---

### Tips and Best Practices

#### Workflow Optimization
- **Start each session fresh**: Use `list --all` to check what projects you have
- **Use descriptive project names**: Makes filtering and organizing easier later
- **Set realistic deadlines**: Helps with priority management and sorting
- **Export regularly**: Since data doesn't persist, save important snapshots throughout your work session

#### Task Management
- **Mark tasks as done regularly**: Helps track progress with the `status` command
- **Use priority levels strategically**: 
  - `high` for urgent/important tasks
  - `medium` for regular tasks
  - `low` for nice-to-have items
- **Set deadlines wisely**: Even if approximate, deadlines help with sorting and planning

#### Export Strategies
- **End-of-session export**: Always export before typing `bye` to preserve your work
- **Filtered exports**: Create focused task lists for specific needs
- **Deadline-sorted exports**: Great for weekly planning

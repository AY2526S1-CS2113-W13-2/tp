I see, another forgetful human who needs help remembering commands.

Tip: Wrap multi-word project names in double quotes (e.g. "Birthday Bash").
 1. create-project <project>               - Add a new project
 2. add-task <project> <desc> [--priority low/medium/high] [--deadline YYYY-MM-DD]
 3. list-all                        - List all projects
 4. list <project>              - List tasks in a project
 5. mark <project> <index>      - Mark task as done
 6. unmark <project> <index>    - Mark task as not done
 7. delete-project <project>            - Delete a project
 8. delete-task <project> <index>    - Delete a task
 9. update <project> <index> [--description <desc>] [--deadline YYYY-MM-DD|none] [--priority low/medium/high] - Update a task
10. sort tasks by deadline/priority ascending/descending - Sort all tasks
11. filter tasks by priority <value> - Filter tasks by priority
12. filter tasks by project <name> - Filter tasks by project name
13. export tasks to <filename>.txt [<project>] [filter by <type> <value>] [sort by <field> <order>] - Export tasks to TXT file
14. export tasks to <filename>.txt --all - Force export all tasks
15. help                        - Show this help message
16. bye                         - Exit the application

Hmph, if you're too lazy or forgetful to remember these commands...
just type the main command like 'add', 'create', 'list', 'mark', 'unmark', 'delete',
'update', 'sort', 'filter', 'export', or 'help'.
It's not like I'll guide you through everything step by step or anything!
Don't get the wrong idea - I'm only doing this because I have to...
